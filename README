This Quickstart will allow you to very quickly get Trac running on openshift.

How to use this quickstart:
Create a new application on openshift.redhat.com.

For "Choose type of application" -> scroll to bottom and select 'do it yourself'

For public URL, name the application name what you would want your Trac repo to be named, i.e. ProjectX
Click Create application

Clone the github Repo:
git clone https://github.com/brianwcook/openshift-diy-trac.git

cd into the git dir: 
cd openshift-diy-trac

Add your openshift application git repo as a remote:
git remote add openshift [your openshift git repo URL here]

Overwrite your openshift repo:
git push -f openshift

Visit your site and trac should be up and running!
